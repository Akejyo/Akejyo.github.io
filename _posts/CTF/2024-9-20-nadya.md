Funny, I find the puzzle just in this site, now I'm back.

Check the code of this site â†’ ` <!--6e616479616e61792e6d652f77697265642e747874 -->`

It's a hex ascii code, decode â†’ `nadyanay.me/wired.txt`

In this .txt file, I find some strange capital letters, separate out these letters:

```c++
void solve() {
    ifstream fin("wired.txt");
    string s;
    while (fin >> s)
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
            if (s[i] >= 'A' && s[i] <= 'Z')
                cout << s[i];
}
```

```

Back to the site [Lovehost - Comfy hosting (aishitei.ru)](https://aishitei.ru/?waifu=19), I have no idea where `OMNIPRESENCE MKZ` and `OMNIPRESENCE OMNIPRESENCE` are. So I try to get the whole site resource:

```shell
wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=1 "https://aishitei.ru"
```

Only `empty.png` , those waifu pic are not static resource.

Back to where? Back to Lain.

Try this: https://aishitei.ru/images/mascots/omnipresence.mkz

OK, nothing.ðŸ¤“

I find the file suffix is strange, let's try .mzv instead.

`omnipresence.omnipresence` has some 'X' 'O' letters, looks like this:

```
 O|X|X
 X| |O
 O|O|O
 O|X|X
 X| |O
 O|X|O
 ...
```

Maybe it's tictactoe, basing on the amount of 'X' and 'O', we may can know which letter should be put in the blank.

After some tries, it really disappointed me that this may not that complex as what I thought, just considering 'O' as 0, 'X' as 1, and than you get the code of ascii. Like this:

```
 O|X|X
 X| |O
 O|O|O

 O|X|X
 X| |O
 O|X|O

 O|X|X
 O| |O
 X|O|X
```

```
0111 7 p
0000 0
0111 7 r
0010 2
0110 6 e
0101 5
```

Let's write a program to decode:

```c++
void solve() {
    ifstream fin("omnipresence.omnipresence");
    string s, result;
    while (fin >> s) {
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == 'O' || c == 'X')
                result += c;
        }
    }
    string asc;
    int cnt = 0, val = 0;
    for (auto c : result) {
        val = (val << 1) | (c == 'X');
        if (++cnt == 8) {
            asc += static_cast<char>(val);
            cnt = val = 0;
        }
    }
    cout << asc;
}
```

present day
present time
how does it feel
to have entered the wired?
this is the final step
you must escape
```

For `omnipresence.mkz`, I find it has no sound, but you can use MKVToolNix to extract the sound track of it, which is just normal OP.

Present day, Present time. The word 'present' has various meanings, but we can know it's true meaning from the original japenese. It should mean 'gift'

So what, I still don't know what to do next :(
